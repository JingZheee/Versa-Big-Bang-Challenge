# Script to Generate Number Replacement Output

This script iterates through numbers 1 to 100 and replaces them based on divisibility rules:

* Divisible by 3: Replaced with "BIG"
* Divisible by 5: Replaced with "BANG"
* Divisible by both 3 and 5: Replaced with "BIG BANG"

The script generates a JSON file named "output.json" containing the results.
